# Mitzvah Day with Lava Mae

Congratulations to all classes! You did a great job and we have collected our basic kits, as well as <strong>four</strong> additional items! Thank you for your generosity!

Thanks to you, we will be putting together roughly <u>600</u> kits that each include:

- Shampoo
- Body Wash
- Toothbrush
- Toothpaste
- Lotion
- Lip balm
- Socks
- Hand Sanitizer
- Granola bar

These will be a wonderful and generous gift from our temple community to those around us! Thank you everyone, again, for this fantastic project! 

Next, be sure to stop by Temple on May 5th from 10AM to 12PM to help us assemble these kits, and then stay 12PM-1PM to eat lunch and celebrate with us! We can't wait to see you all there!
