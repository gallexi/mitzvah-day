# Mitzvah Day with Lava Mae

Congratulations to all classes! You did a great job and we have collected our basic kits.  However, Lava Mae has some additional items on their wish list. We encourage you to keep shopping, post to FB, ask you contacts to help out.  Thank you for your generosity!  Happy shopping (through April 21st)! Kits will be put together May 5th.‚Äù
